# What is Machine Learning
- Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building computer systems that learn from data. The broad range of techniques ML encompasses enables software applications to improve their performance over time.
- Machine learning algorithms are trained to find relationships and patterns in data. They use historical data as input to make predictions, classify information, cluster data points, reduce dimensionality and even help generate new content, as demonstrated by new ML-fueled applications such as ChatGPT, Dall-E 2 and GitHub Copilot.
