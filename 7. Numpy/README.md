# Numpy

## Why Numpy?
- NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is open-source software.
### Features of Numpy
- A powerful N-dimensional array object
- Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

- It is fast
- Behind the scenes optimization written in C
- Vectorization via broadcasting (avoiding loops)
- Backbone to other python scientific packages
