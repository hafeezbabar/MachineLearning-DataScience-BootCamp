# Machine Learning Models 
Hi, My friend said he wants to build a Machine Learning model. It is  easy right....!

## Scikitlearn Library



## Why Scikit-Learn
 - Built on Numpy and Matplotlib (and Python)
 - Has many in-built machine learning models
 - Methods to evaluate your machine learning models
 - Very well designed API

### We cover here:
 - A end-to-end Scikit-Learn workflow
 - Getting data ready (to be used with machine learning models)
 - Choosing a machine learning model
 - Fiting a model to the data (learning pattern)
 - Make Predictions with a model (using pattern)
 - Evaluating model predictions
 - Improving model predictions
 - Saving and loading models
